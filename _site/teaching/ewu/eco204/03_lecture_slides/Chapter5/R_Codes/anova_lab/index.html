## Doing one way ANOVA

Let's load the service data

```{r}
library(readxl)
# Load the data
data1 &lt;- read_excel("/home/tanvir/Documents/ownCloud/Git_Repos/EWU_repos/3_Fall_2023/eco_204/ewu-eco204.github.io/pdf_files/slides/05_anova/Codes/service_data_1.xlsx")

# this data is in wide format
# look at the column names
data1
```

This data is in wide format and we need to convert this data to long format before running codes for ANOVA (to understand the difference between the wide and long format you can read [this page (click here)](https://libguides.princeton.edu/R-reshape#:~:text=Introduction%20of%20wide%20and%20long,repeat%20in%20the%20first%20column.&amp;text=We%20can%20see%20that%20in,value%20in%20the%20first%20column.) ). There is a classic function in R called `reshape` to convert the data from wide to long format. But I think now there is an excellent package called `tidyr` which does the job beautifully and also it's a good package to learn ([check this](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/)). We will use a function  `pivot_longer` from the `tidyr` package to convert these kind of data sets in a long format.


```{r}

# load the tidyr package
library(tidyr)

# reshape the data to long format
data1_long &lt;- pivot_longer(data1, cols = 1:3, names_to = c("service"), values_to = c("score"))

```


Here 
- data1 is our datain wideformat
- cols = 1:3 means we want to convert column 1 to 3 to long
- names_to = c("service") the converted column will be named as service
- values_to = the $Y$ values in the converted column will be named as score

Now let's look at the data

```{r}
data1_long
```

We also need to convert the service variable to factor before running the ANOVA

```{r}
# convert the service to factor
data1_long$service &lt;- as.factor(data1_long$service)


# check the summary stats
summary(data1_long)

```

Now finally we will run the `aov()` function to run the ANOVA, notice the syntax is similar to the `lm()` function

```{r}
# now we are ready to run anova
anova_result1 &lt;- aov(score ~ service, data =data1_long)
summary(anova_result1)

```


## Doing two way ANOVA

Now let's do it for two way. The procedure is similar

```{r}
# Load the data
data2 &lt;- read_excel("/home/tanvir/Documents/ownCloud/Git_Repos/EWU_repos/3_Fall_2023/eco_204/ewu-eco204.github.io/pdf_files/slides/05_anova/Codes/service_data_2.xlsx")

# look at the column names
names(data2)
```

```{r}
# reshape from wide to long, we will use pivot_longer from tidyr package
data2_long &lt;- pivot_longer(data2, cols = starts_with("Service"), names_to = c("service"), values_to = c("score"))


# rename the columns
names(data2_long) &lt;- c("student", "service", "score")

# convert the service and stduent variable to factor
data2_long$service &lt;- as.factor(data2_long$service)
data2_long$student &lt;- as.factor(data2_long$student)

summary(data2_long)
```

Now the run the aov function

```{r}

anova_result2 &lt;- aov(score ~ service + student , data = data2_long)
summary(anova_result2)

```


## ANOVA Vs. LM

Actually ANOVA is a special case of LM. To see this you can run the `lm()` function for the two way ANOVA data and run `anova()` function, then you will get the same result as the `aov()` function

```{r}
lm_result &lt;- lm(score ~ service + student , data = data2_long)

summary(lm_result)

# in this case the anova function will give you the same result as the aov function
anova(lm_result)
```

Now you should understand what does the `anova` function do in R. It runs the `lm()` function removing each of the variable one by one and then compares the model with the full model and gives you the result.
