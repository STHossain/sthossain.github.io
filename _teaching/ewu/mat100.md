## <span style="color: darkblue;">Tentative Course Outline</span>:

This is an introductory level course on Mathematics offered for the undergraduate students from Business, Economics, Pharmacy and other departments. The core topics are Functions, Differential and Integral Calculus, Matrix Algebra and some Counting Methods, e.g., Permutation and Combination. More or less we will start from scratch, so no previous knowledge of Calculus or Matrix algebra is required. However, you are expected to think critically and understand the problem rather than just memorizing formulas and applying them.

Here is the list of topics in detail:

- **<span style="color: purple;">Derivatives / Differential Calculus:</span>** Functions, Limits & Continuity, Techniques of Differentiation, Maxima and Minima of Functions, Point of Inflection, Functions of Two or More Variables, Partial Derivatives.
- **<span style="color: purple;">Integral Calculus:</span>** Integration as an inverse of Differentiation, Integration as an area problem, Techniques of Integration - Integration by substitution, Integration by parts, Calculating definite Integrals.
- **<span style="color: purple;">Counting Methods:</span>** Some basic counting methods like - Multiplication rules, Permutation, Combination and Binomial theorem.
- **<span style="color: purple;">Matrix Calculus:</span>** Introduction to Matrices, Different types of Matrices (e.g., Identity Matrix, Diagonal Matrix) and Matrix operations, Finding inverse of a Matrix. Using Matrices to solve systems of linear equations by using both Gauss Jordan Elimination Algorithm and Inverse Method, Cramerâ€™s rule.

## <span style="color: darkblue;">Learning Outcomes</span>:

1. Understanding the basic concepts of functions, classification of functions, and the graphs.
2. Identify and compute the systems of linear equations by using various methods.
3. Describe the various types of matrices and use the techniques of matrix operations.
4. Understand the basic concept of derivative and familiarize with the various rules of differentiation to solve problems.
5. Describe the concept of permutation and combination, problem solutions, state and expand the binomial theorem with problem solution.
6. Understand the basic concept of integral and familiarize with the various rules of integration to solve problems.

## <span style="color: darkblue;">Reference Books</span>:

There are several books which could be profitably used for this course. Barnett, Ziegler, Byleen, and Stocker (2019) is an easy reference and a good one. This is the primary reference. However, for Calculus, Thomas and Finney (1996) is an excellent reference and from time to time we will need that. Also, Stewart, Clegg, and Watson (2020) and Anton, Bivens, and Davis (2011) are classics. I will give more details in the class.

Mathematics is the language of Science, so needless to say, for any scientific study you need Math. Actually, nowadays, even if you study medicine or business, sometimes you need to know a good level of Math. Often some students think "math is only for some genius guys and I was dumb in school so math is not for me". This idea is wrong and quite frankly very damaging. Real life scenario is often quite contrary to this and many math students learn proper math at the University. In principle, you can learn mathematics at any age. Yes, sometimes it can be challenging, however, it can also be very fun and enjoyable too! And now, in this era of Science and Technology, this might be a valuable resource.
