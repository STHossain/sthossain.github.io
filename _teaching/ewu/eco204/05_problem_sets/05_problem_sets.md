### Problems from Time Series, Two Sample Testing, and ANOVA

*Time Series:*

We almost covered everything from Chapter 17 (Except one particular technique - Exponential smoothing, and the last chapter 17.6). Exponential smoothing is really an easy concept, but I am sorry I actually forgot this when I was teaching this chapter. And then I didn’t have time to cover this topic. As an alternative I decided to record a video in sha Allah and will also try to give you short notes and possibly you have to solve one simple exercise as part of your project work…. but let's see…. Now from this chapter, ideally you should be able to solve any problem From, 17.1, 17.2, 17.3 (Problems except exponential smoothing), 17.4 and 17.5

*Anova:*

Here also you should be able to solve all problems from 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3 (these are two sample t-tests), and also problems from 13.1, 13.2, and 13.4.
