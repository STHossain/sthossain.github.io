## Plan for 14th, 16th and 18th November

For the continuous hartals, we need to plan a bit ahead now. This is because if we want to have makeup classes on Saturday then there is a huge competition for the room, and we might not get free rooms. So here is the plan now,

- 14th November, Tuesday: It seems, so far there is nothing Tuesday. So we will have regular class on Tuesday, so just follow the schedule for regular class.

- 16th November, Thursday: So far there is nothing on Thursday. But we don't know for sure yet. So here is the plan,
	- If there is an oborodh / hartal then we won't have any class.
	- But if there is NO oborodh, then we will have our class.

- 18th November, Saturday: There will be a class on Saturday, 3:10 PM - 4:40 PM, Room 531. We will have class on this Saturday regardless of whether there is an oborodh on Thursday or not. *So even if there is no oborodh on 16th, we will still have our class.* 



## 9th Oct - Online Class

I know that it's always best (both for me and for the students) to have the classes on campus. But I think in this week I cannot take classes on Friday/Saturday for you.  First of all, I don't want to take classes on Fridays, and on Saturday I cannot freely book the rooms because some of you have midterms. So with all this, I decided to take online class in this week on Thursday 9th of October, 2023, same timing, 1.30 to 3.00 PM. So we will have online class tomorrow, 9th of October, 2023, 1.30 to 3.00 PM.


## 29 th Oct - Hartal on 29th, Online Class Same time

I think it has already been announced that there will be a hartal tomorrow (29th Oct). The University didn't let us know anything yet. So I don't know what's going to happen at our Uni tomorrow, however I think it's better if we have an online class, is this problem for anyone? Can you please let me know in Ed Discussion if you have any problem with online class tomorrow? If I don't find any objections, then I will assume you are ok with online class during our class time, so 1.30 PM to 3.00 PM. I will send a GoogleMeet link. 

## Attend Online Classes with PC

Please try to attend the online classes with your computer, rather than your cell phone. Because we will do some computer stuff today. You can also join the link with both of your cell phone and PC if you want. Maybe if you want to hear the class with your cell phone, and practice on your PC, it's your choice. Anyways, what I wanted to say is, try to open a PC when you do the class so that you can practice along.
