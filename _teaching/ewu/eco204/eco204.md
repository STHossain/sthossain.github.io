Only 64 percent of children go on to complete secondary education. Don't you think this is worrying? We have 58 million children, who represent 34 percent of the population, so surely they will be the future workforce. The question is, are we going in the right direction?

Economists often think about these problems, try to find useful numbers or statistics (like 64 percent in this example), analyze these numbers, and finally try to solve these problems at the policy level. So, numbers are important, and **statistics are important!**

## 2. Course Description
This is a continuation of the course ECO104. The students will be introduced to Inferential Statistics, and the core topics are, 
- Point and Interval Estimation, 
- Hypothesis Testing, 
- Simple and Multiple Linear Regression Model, 
- Basic Time Series Analysis, 
- Goodness of fit test and some Non-Parametric tests (e.g., sign test and rank test), if time permits!, 
- Analysis of Variance Techniques.

The course follows a balanced approach between theory and practice. Students will learn the concepts and also apply them using R. There will be a lab project to evaluate the applied skills.

## 3. Prerequisite Courses
- ECO101 and ECO104 offered at the East West University.

## 4. Textbooks / Notes
There will be lecture notes (typed), and you should definitely read that first. In addition, I recommend to use any of the following books for exercises and practice problems:

1. Anderson, Sweeney, Williams, Camm, Cochran, Fry and Ohlmann (2020)
2. Newbold, Carlson and Thorne (2020)

Following books are a bit advanced at this level, but nevertheless these are also excellent references. In particular, if you are an Economics student, you should look into Wooldridge (2019).

4. DeGroot and Schervish (2012)
5. Casella and Berger (2002)
6. Wooldridge (2019)

## 5. Marks Distribution

### How to Install R and Rstudio

To use R in R studio, first you need to install R and then R studio

- Download R using this link [https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/R-4.3.2-win.exe](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/R-4.3.2-win.exe)

- Download Rstudio using this link [https://download1.rstudio.org/electron/windows/RStudio-2023.09.0-463.exe](https://download1.rstudio.org/electron/windows/RStudio-2023.09.0-463.exe)

Careful! first you have to install R and then Rstudio, DO NOT install Rstudio fIrst and then R.


###  Regarding R and Introductory Video, code files, data

From now on I will use R a lot. Because I believe Statistics is something where the computer plays a very important role and this is especially true now than in older times. So please start yourself comfortable using R. I promise you that I will try my best to help you out if you get stuck, so please try! You can ask me always questions about using R, so please do ask! Here are some resources

- **Video to start with R:**  This is a lecture from a course offered at Stanford from two legends, Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani. [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L03A81OgLlk&list=PLoROMvodv4rOzrYsAxzQyHb8n_RWNuS1e&index=8&ab_channel=StanfordOnline) to see the video

- **R code file for the video:** [Ch2-statlearn-lab_videocode.R](04_R_RStudio/Ch2-statlearn-lab_videocode.R)

- **Data Set:** You might need this data file [Auto.csv](04_R_RStudio/Auto.csv). Put this CSV file in a folder and then load the data how we loaded in the class, after that, you can continue to follow the commands in the video


Please ask me questions if you get stuck.

### Problems from Time Series, Two Sample Testing, and ANOVA

*Time Series:*

We almost covered everything from Chapter 17 (Except one particular technique - Exponential smoothing, and the last chapter 17.6). Exponential smoothing is really an easy concept, but I am sorry I actually forgot this when I was teaching this chapter. And then I didn’t have time to cover this topic. As an alternative I decided to record a video in sha Allah and will also try to give you short notes and possibly you have to solve one simple exercise as part of your project work…. but let's see…. Now from this chapter, ideally you should be able to solve any problem From, 17.1, 17.2, 17.3 (Problems except exponential smoothing), 17.4 and 17.5

*Anova:*

Here also you should be able to solve all problems from 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3 (these are two sample t-tests), and also problems from 13.1, 13.2, and 13.4.



## 11. Lab Project


### There will be a Group Project

At the end of the semester there will be a group project, so please form a group of 2/3 people. I will give the topics as soon as I can 

There are two options for you, either use MS-Word or use LaTeX.


**For MS Word Users**

This is easier but generally MSWord is a very painful software when it comes to consistency (sorry to say this), e.g., it breaks down arbitrarily and I dont' like this. So when it comes to good writing or perhaps long writing, I would prefer LaTeX. However for this course it's no problem if you use MS-Word. But you should carefully handle the formatting. Please watch the video that I recorded and the template 

- **Video**: I recorded a video before for typing the project in MSWord, please watch this and submit the project following these guidelines. The video is available in the playlist, but here is also the link
  - Video link [https://youtu.be/M1pKWGRTrjw](https://youtu.be/M1pKWGRTrjw)

- **Template**: Please submit the PDF file such that its formatting is similar to the template (details in the video)
  - **Word file:**
    - [ECO204_Template.docx](../06_lab_projects/MS-Word_Stuffs/ECO204_Template.docx)
  - **PDF output file:**
    - [ECO204_Template.pdf](../06_lab_projects/MS-Word_Stuffs/ECO204_Template.pdf)

---

**For TeX Users**

You can use LaTeX. Definitely this needs more effort if this is your firs time, but at the same time if you want to pick up this skill while doing this project, please try this. I will try my level best to support you.

- **Videos**: I recorded two very short videos for LaTeX
  - Video link 1: [https://youtu.be/aICtwTIlyWQ](https://youtu.be/aICtwTIlyWQ) (Open Account in Overleaf)
  - Video link 2: [https://youtu.be/dTMOiw55UAU](https://youtu.be/dTMOiw55UAU) (How to use the Template)

- **Template Zipped Folder**
  - [Project_Paper_Template_EWU.zip](../06_lab_projects/LaTeX_Stuffs/Project_Paper_Template_EWU.zip)

- **R Files that I used in the video (but you need to use your own R file)**
  - [Rplotscatter.png](../06_lab_projects/LaTeX_Stuffs/Rplotscatter.png)
  - [armands.xlsx](../06_lab_projects/LaTeX_Stuffs/armands.xlsx)
  - [Armands_Code.R](../06_lab_projects/LaTeX_Stuffs/Armands_Code.R)

- **Sample PDF Output**
  - [ECO204_pdf_LaTeX.pdf](../06_lab_projects/LaTeX_Stuffs/ECO204_pdf_LaTeX.pdf)


## 12. Additional Resources

### Other Course  Materials

Here are some nice materials from Professor John Levendis at Loyola University of New Orleans. He took a course on Business Statistics and recorded his lectures.

- Check the [complete playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVTgxfhzvMsUtEMtIine6BG2_ZRDg_cq7)

- Some of the contents of ECO 204 are very similar to the second part of this course. Also, the first part of this course covers similar materials to ECO104. So this might be very useful for you. 

- One important thing if you see his lectures (it's completely optional for you), the notations could be slightly different. For example when a random variable $$X$$ follows normal distribution with mean $$\mu$$ and variance $$\sigma^2$$, I will write $$X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$$, however Professor Lavendis wrote $$X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma)$$. The writings are just different, but the underlying objects are the same. I am using  $$X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$$, because I think this is more standard! ...Again this is just a notational difference. 

### Some animations

Sometimes Animations (which is done using something called "simulations" in Statistics) help a lot to understand. Here are some

- Animations of Normal Distributions, [click here](https://www.geogebra.org/m/nrgtzj5a)

<img src="../09_additional_resources/images/normal_animation.png" width="600" height="500" > 

- Animations of **sampling distributions of means** when data is coming from iid normal. Let $$X_1, X_2, X_3, \ldots, X_n$$ are all Normally distributed. We know from theory that the sampling distribution of the sample means will also be normal, click on [this link](https://www.geogebra.org/m/kUmJeEwx) to have a nice computer simulation using Geogebra.
