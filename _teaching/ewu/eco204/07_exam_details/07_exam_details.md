## *How to Prepare for Mid-1*

Here are my suggestions,

### Solve Problems of Anderson (Chapter 8)
{: .no_toc }
Please solve all the problems of of 8.1 and 8.2 in the Problem Set - 1. Make sure you solve them with understanding what you are doing and why. I haven't taught 8.4 so you can skip the problems for 8.4. You can also skip 8.3 for the Midterm - 1. But please make sure you are smooth in 8.1 and 8.2 problems.

### Solve Problems of Anderson (Chapter 9)
{: .no_toc }
Solve all the problems in Problem Set - 2.

### Read the slides carefully
{: .no_toc }
You can bring your own printout of slides in the Exam. Only the slides are allowed and nothing else. But honestly for the time constraint you won't have time to understand from the slides during exam. The exam will be very tight. I am allowing you to bring the slides, because I know that these concepts are  hard to digest when you see it first. But honestly you won't have enough time to go through the slides in the Exam. It can only help you if you forget something.

I will make 60% questions similar to problem set, and 40% theoretical questions which will include true false type questions or maybe short but conceptual questions. Please start preparing as early as you can. Let  me know if you have any questions.

## *How to Prepare for Mid-2*

### Solve Problem Set 2
{: .no_toc }
Please try to solve the first two problems (Question 1 and Question 2 of PS2). You can skip number 3. Check that whether you can understand the questions and try to answer them using R. Please write the R codes by yourself 4 or 5 times at least so that you have good practice. 

## What can you bring in the exam?
{: .no_toc }
I have given an R lab file (slr_lab.pdf) (which has all the R codes except the prediction commands). You can print out this and bring it. You can write whatever you want in the printout. **Only this file is allowed**

### How will be the questions? 
{: .no_toc }
his time there will be some theoretical questions and some applied or data related problems. I haven't thought how much theory or applied problems I will give in the exam, but you should go through the slides and try to review the concepts as much as you can.

## *How to Prepare for Final*

### Read the slides carefully and understand the concept
{: .no_toc }
Final Exam will be a lot conceptual with execution of R codes, so please try to read the slides and understand the concept. I have tried my best to prepare the slides as best as I could, but of course I am not claiming it's the best and I know there is always a room for improvement, so I am sorry if still  something is unclear. 

### Practice, practice and practice with R as much as you
{: .no_toc }
I will allow to bring some cheat sheets (see below), but exam will be very very tight. So unless you are smooth in R you won't be able to answer all questions. If you expect that in exam time you will see your sheet and execute something for the first time, honestly it will take lots of time for you. Exam is not a place for experiment, it's a place where you execute your preparation. So please go through all the problems that we covered in the class and also in the problem set. Try to reproduce the result completely by yourself.  

### Everything has to be on paper
{: .no_toc }
The questions will be slightly different than midterms and it will be such that you will execute codes and write the answer in your paper. Since for faculties we have to submit final exam papers, so you will have to write all answers in your paper. 

### Cheat Sheet
{: .no_toc }
You are allowed to bring one A4 size paper as a cheat sheet, where you can write codes or whatever you want. Since this is the Final Exam, I will be strict here. If I see anything in your desk other than the cheat sheet or in the screen other than a new R studio window, I will have to be very strict and punish you (by confiscating your script for some time or cancelling your script). The point of the cheat sheet is if something is harder to remember for you, then you can write it down. But if you expect you will write something new and try to understand this "new thing" in exam, it's not a good idea. Again no printed thing is allowed this time.

For now that's it, I will write if something comes up, let me know if you have any questions.
