### There will be a Group Project

At the end of the semester there will be a group project, so please form a group of 2/3 people. I will give the topics as soon as I can 


### How to Type or Submit

There are two options for you, either use MS-Word or use LaTeX.


### - **For MS Word Users**

This is easier but generally MSWord is a very painful software when it comes to consistency (sorry to say this), e.g., it breaks down arbitrarily and I dont' like this. So when it comes to good writing or perhaps long writing, I would prefer LaTeX. However for this course it's no problem if you use MS-Word. But you should carefully handle the formatting. Please watch the video that I recorded and the template 

- **Video**: I recorded a video before for typing the project in MSWord, please watch this and submit the project following these guidelines. The video is available in the playlist, but here is also the link

- **Template**: Please submit the PDF file such that its formatting is similar to the template (details in the video)
  - **Word file:**
    - [ECO204_Template.docx](MS-Word_Stuffs/ECO204_Template.docx)
  - **PDF output file:**
    - [ECO204_Template.pdf](MS-Word_Stuffs/ECO204_Template.pdf)

### - **For TeX Users**

You can use LaTeX. Definitely this needs more effort if this is your firs time, but at the same time if you want to pick up this skill while doing this project, please try this. I will try my level best to support you.

- **Videos**: I recorded two very short videos for LaTeX
  - Video link 1: [https://youtu.be/aICtwTIlyWQ](https://youtu.be/aICtwTIlyWQ) (Open Account in Overleaf)
  - Video link 2: [https://youtu.be/dTMOiw55UAU](https://youtu.be/dTMOiw55UAU) (How to use the Template)

- **Template Zipped Folder**
  - [Project_Paper_Template_EWU.zip](LaTeX_Stuffs/Project_Paper_Template_EWU.zip)

- **R Files that I used in the video (but you need to use your own R file)**
  - [Rplotscatter.png](LaTeX_Stuffs/Rplotscatter.png)
  - [armands.xlsx](LaTeX_Stuffs/armands.xlsx)
  - [Armands_Code.R](LaTeX_Stuffs/Armands_Code.R)

- **Sample PDF Output**
  - [ECO204_pdf_LaTeX.pdf](LaTeX_Stuffs/ECO204_pdf_LaTeX.pdf)
