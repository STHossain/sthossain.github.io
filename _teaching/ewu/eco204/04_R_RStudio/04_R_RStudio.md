## How to Install R and Rstudio

To use R in R studio, first you need to install R and then R studio

- Download R using this link [https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/R-4.3.2-win.exe](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/R-4.3.2-win.exe)

Careful! first you have to install R and then Rstudio, DO NOT install Rstudio fIrst and then R.


##  Regarding R and Introductory Video, code files, data

From now on I will use R a lot. Because I believe Statistics is something where the computer plays a very important role and this is especially true now than in older times. So please start yourself comfortable using R. I promise you that I will try my best to help you out if you get stuck, so please try! You can ask me always questions about using R, so please do ask! Here are some resources

- **Video to start with R:**  This is a lecture from a course offered at Stanford from two legends, Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani. [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L03A81OgLlk&list=PLoROMvodv4rOzrYsAxzQyHb8n_RWNuS1e&index=8&ab_channel=StanfordOnline) to see the video

- **R code file for the video:** [Ch2-statlearn-lab_videocode.R](Ch2-statlearn-lab_videocode.R)

- **Data Set:** You might need this data file [Auto.csv](Auto.csv). Put this CSV file in a folder and then load the data how we loaded in the class, after that, you can continue to follow the commands in the video


Please ask me questions if you get stuck.
