## Additional Resources

### Materials from Professor John Levendis at Loyola University of New Orleans

Here are some nice materials from Professor John Levendis at Loyola University of New Orleans. He took a course on Business Statistics and recorded his lectures.

- Check the [complete playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVTgxfhzvMsUtEMtIine6BG2_ZRDg_cq7)

- Some of the contents of ECO 204 are very similar to the second part of this course. Also, the first part of this course covers similar materials to ECO104. So this might be very useful for you. 

- One important thing if you see his lectures (it's completely optional for you), the notations could be slightly different. For example when a random variable $$X$$ follows normal distribution with mean $$\mu$$ and variance $$\sigma^2$$, I will write $$X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$$, however Professor Lavendis wrote $$X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma)$$. The writings are just different, but the underlying objects are the same. I am using  $$X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$$, because I think this is more standard! ...Again this is just a notational difference. 

### Some animations

Sometimes Animations (which is done using something called "simulations" in Statistics) help a lot to understand. Here are some

- Animations of Normal Distributions, [click here](https://www.geogebra.org/m/nrgtzj5a)

- Animations of **sampling distributions of means** when data is coming from iid normal. Let $$X_1, X_2, X_3, \ldots, X_n$$ are all Normally distributed. We know from theory that the sampling distribution of the sample means will also be normal, click on [this link](https://www.geogebra.org/m/kUmJeEwx) to have a nice computer simulation using Geogebra.
