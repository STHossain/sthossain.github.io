Currently I am  enrolled as a doctoral student at the Business and Economics Department at the <a href="https://www.tu-dortmund.de/en/" target="_blank">Technical University of Dortmund (TU Dortmund), Germany</a> and working on my dissertation. I have been also an adjunct lecturer at the Economics Department of <a href="https://www.ewubd.edu/" target="_blank">East West University, Bangladesh</a>. From 2018 - 2022, as a doctoral student, I was also a research associate (in German Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter) at the Department of Statistics at TU Dortmund (<a href="https://lwus.statistik.tu-dortmund.de/en/chair/alumni/" target="_blank">alumni page</a>), and I gratefully acknowledge all their support and guidance.

I completed M.Sc. in Economics from the <a href="https://www.uni-mannheim.de/en/" target="_blank">University of Mannheim, Germany</a>, and Bachelors in Business with a second major in Economics from <a href="https://www.bracu.ac.bd/" target="_blank">BRAC University, Bangladesh</a>. My research interests lie at the intersection of Causal Inference, Econometrics, and Machine Learning (both theoretical and applied works).

Throughtout my academic career I have been blessed to have many amazing teachers and mentors  without whom I would not have reached where I am today. Their guidance, wisdom, and encouragement have been instrumental in my life. In particular I always feel indebted to [Professor Carsten Jentsch](https://lwus.statistik.tu-dortmund.de/en/chair/team/jentsch/), for his belief in my potential which pushed me to continue striving for excellence since my masters, [Professor Wasiqur Rahman Khan](https://www.bracu.ac.bd/about/people/wasiqur-rahman-khan-phd), for his continuous support since my bachelors, [Professor M. Ataharul Islam (late)](https://isrt.ac.bd/people/mataharul/), for his belief that I can learn Statistics (he is the one who exposed me to the beauty of Statistics), and [Professor A.M. Tanvir Hussain](https://fbe.ewubd.edu/economics-department/faculty-view/hussain), for his amazing support which was always there when I needed it most, must say - his door was always open for his students.

I am also grateful to my family and friends who have always been there for me. I enjoy coding and I love to learn new things. You can find my CV in pdf [here](/assets/pdf/CV_STHossain.pdf), more about what courses I taught as well as some course materials in the in the  [teaching](/_pages/teaching.md) page, papers I am currently working in the [research](/_pages/research.md)  page and some additional details in the  [more-details](/_pages/more-details.md) page.
