I am enrolled as doctoral student at the Business Economics Department of <a href="https://www.tu-dortmund.de/en/" target="_blank">Technical University of Dortmund</a>. From 2018 - 2022, as a doctoral student, I was also a research associate (in German Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter) at the Department of Statistics (<a href="https://lwus.statistik.tu-dortmund.de/en/chair/alumni/" target="_blank">Chair of Business and Social Statistics</a>). Currently I am also an adjunct lecturer at the Economics Department of <a href="https://www.ewubd.edu/" target="_blank">East West University, Bangladesh</a>

I completed my masters in Economics from the <a href="https://www.uni-mannheim.de/en/" target="_blank">University of Mannheim, Germany</a>, and I did my bachelors in Business and Economics from <a href="https://www.bracu.ac.bd/" target="_blank">BRAC University, Bangladesh</a>. My research interest lies in intersection of Causal Inference, Econometrics and Machine Learning (both in theory and applied works), and I love coding. 

You can find my CV [here](/assets/pdf/CV_STHossain.pdf) and I give a bit more deatils about me in the page [Some Details]
