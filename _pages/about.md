Currently I am an adjunct lecturer at the Economics Department of <a href="https://www.ewubd.edu/" target="_blank">East West University, Bangladesh</a>. From 2018 - 2022, as a doctoral student, I was a research associate (in German Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter) at the Department of Statistics (<a href="https://lwus.statistik.tu-dortmund.de/en/chair/alumni/" target="_blank">Chair of Business and Social Statistics</a>) at <a href="https://www.tu-dortmund.de/en/" target="_blank">Technical University of Dortmund (TU Dortmund), Germany</a>. I am still enrolled as a doctoral student at the Business and Economics Department of TU Dortmund and working on my dissertation. 

I completed M.Sc. in Economics from the <a href="https://www.uni-mannheim.de/en/" target="_blank">University of Mannheim, Germany</a>, and B.B.A. with a second major in Economics from <a href="https://www.bracu.ac.bd/" target="_blank">BRAC University, Bangladesh</a>. My research interests lie at the intersection of Causal Inference, Econometrics, and Machine Learning (both theoretical and applied work), and I love coding.
You can find my CV [here](/assets/pdf/CV_STHossain.pdf) and in the page [more details](/_pages/more_details.md) you can see some additional details.
