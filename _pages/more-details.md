In this page I try to give more details about my academic career. This section is a bit informal, however I think it's important to give some details.


## Acknowledgements

I begin by acknowledging the invaluable support of my teachers and mentors, without whom I would not have reached where I am today. Their guidance, wisdom, and encouragement have been instrumental in my life. There were moments in my path when the everything ahead seemed uncertain, I faced setbacks and lost every hope. But they always gave me support. And no matter how many times I give thanks, it will never be enough. In particular, I would like to thank [Professor Carsten Jentsch](https://lwus.statistik.tu-dortmund.de/en/chair/team/jentsch/), for his belief in my potential which pushed me to continue striving for excellence since my masters, [Professor Wasiqur Rahman Khan](https://www.bracu.ac.bd/about/people/wasiqur-rahman-khan-phd), for his continuous support since my bachelors, [Professor M. Ataharul Islam (late)](https://isrt.ac.bd/people/mataharul/), he is the one who motivated me to study statistics, and [Professor A.M. Tanvir Hussain](https://fbe.ewubd.edu/economics-department/faculty-view/hussain), for his amazing support always when I needed it most, his door was always open for his students. Of course, there are many other teachers who have guided me along the way, and I remain deeply grateful to them all.
