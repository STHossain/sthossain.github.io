In this page I try to give more details about my academic career. This section is a bit informal, however I think it's important to give some details.


## Acknowledgements

I begin by acknowledging the invaluable support of my teachers and mentors, without whom I would not have reached where I am today. Their guidance, wisdom, and encouragement have been instrumental in my life. There were moments in my path when the everything ahead seemed uncertain, I faced setbacks and lost every hope. But they always gave me support. And no matter how many times I give thanks, it will never be enough. In particular, I would like to thank Professor Carsten Jentsch[^1] , Professor Wasiqur Rahman Khan[^2], Professor Ataharul Islam (late)[^3], and Professor A.M. Tanvir Hussain[^4] for their profound impact on both my personal and professional growth. Their mentorship has shaped me in ways I cannot fully express (please see the footnotes if you are one them). Of course, there are many other teachers who have guided me along the way, and I remain deeply grateful to them all.
